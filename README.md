# Libft

This project is subject to the 42 core curriculum and allowed me to write my own library 'libft' with standard functions in C.
Writing these functions helped me to understand and specifically learn to use them to, which I'll do in future projects.

Key learning points of this project were:
  - Passing on various types of input and typecasting void pointers
  - Setting up a Makefile to compile my library
  - Familiarise myself with linked lists
 
 Use:
 To compile the library use the command 'make', to compile bonus functions use 'make bonus'.
